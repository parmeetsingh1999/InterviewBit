# Answer is 0.4

The probability distribution function f(x) is defined as:

f(x) = 0.2 for |x| < 1

f(x) = 0.1 for 1 < |x| < 4  

f(x) = 0 otherwise 

For Range 0.5 < x < 1:

P(0.5 < x < 1) = Integrate(upper bound 1 and lower bound 0.5) 0.2 dx = 0.2 (1 - 0.5) = 0.1

For Range 1 < x < 4:

P(1 < x < 4) = Integrate(upper bound 4 and lower bound 1) 0.1 dx = 0.1 (4 - 1) = 0.3

For Range 4 < x < 5:

​P(4 < x < 5) = Integrate(upper bound 5 and lower bound 4) 0 dx = 0 (5 - 4) = 0

Total Probabilty, P(0.5 < x < 5) = P(0.5 < x < 1) + P(1 < x < 4) + ​P(4 < x < 5) = 0.4
